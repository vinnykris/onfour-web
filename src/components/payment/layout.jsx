// Learning
// To best leverage Stripeâ€™s advanced fraud functionality,
// include this script on every page, not just the checkout page.
// This allows Stripe to detect anomalous behavior that may be indicative
// of fraud as customers browse your website.
// Note: This is why we are adding it to a Layout component.

const stripePromise = loadStripe(process.env.REACT_APP_PUBLISHABLE_KEY);


// TIP
// call loadStripe outside of a component
// in that way there's no chance it will get
// called more times than it needs to
