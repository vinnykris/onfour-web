# onfour

This is the public repository for onfour, a live-streaming concert platform. 

## Description

This project was built during the Coronavirus pandemic as an attempt to give musicians a digital stage to perform their work while in-person stages were unavailable. Musicians would stream a live performance from their preferred location, and fans would pay for tickets to watch the show while video-chatting with their friends on the platform itself. 

This project has been archived and will not be maintained further. At the time of this README being published, the platform is accessible via the URL https://onfour.live. If the URL is taken down and you would like to see the project, please reach out to one of our teammates, Vinod Krishnamurthy, at vinodkrishnam@gmail.com!
